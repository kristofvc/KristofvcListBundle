Reporting an issue or a feature request

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project
built using the [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard)
to allow developers of the bundle to reproduce the issue by simply cloning it
and following some steps.

Feel free to fork this project, to contribute and to send us pull requests.

TODO

- More filters
- More templates (not only bootstrap)
